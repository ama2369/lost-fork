# Location-to-Service Translation Protocol

The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol [RFC 5222](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5222.html) has been originally designed for emergency (911) calling services. The protocol provides a mapping service that translates the location (longitude and latitude) of the client, e.g., a mobile phone, to a public safety answering point (PSAP), i.e., a call center, that provides emergency services at the client's location.
